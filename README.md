# Fake News Predictor System

This project builds a **Fake News Detection System** using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).  
The system analyzes news text and predicts whether it is **Real** or **Fake** by applying text cleaning, vectorization, and classification algorithms.

## Contents
- Text preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming, punctuation cleaning)
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Train-test split
- Model training (Logistic Regression / Passive Aggressive Classifier / SVM)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Predicting new unseen news text

## Key Concepts
- NLP pipeline for text classification
- Importance of TF-IDF over Bag-of-Words
- Handling high-dimensional sparse data
- Building a lightweight end-to-end ML text classifier

## Libraries Used
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
